#TODO: [i] Tidy this up.
#TODO: [i] Check the github instructions. Bear in mind the name of the repository will change between versions.


Coding conventions used:

 Use of set and get attribute names, along with aliases for set.
  - Using get/set properties in order to keep a single point of processing on properties (e.g. if I want to change how DOBs are handled, we never use self.dob but instead change it once in self.getDOB().	
  - Unit test names start with testShould (idea from Schneider's comment on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155436/unit-test-naming-best-practices).
