Created 06/08/12 by Fraser Rackham
The current repository on Github is: ukschooldatanalysis-aspirational
Each adjective indicating a version number is one that we would hope that the best students 'are' (e.g. good students are aspirational).

Intended upcoming version names:

UKSDA (UK Schools Data Analysis - WIP name and project) is the outcome of a MSc Project with Kingston University.
The intention is to demonstrate that uk school data analysis (particularly of assessment data) can be handled through an open source, flexible and extensible platform.
